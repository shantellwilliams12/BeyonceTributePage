# BeyonceTributePage

My project is a tribute page dedicated to Beyonce. The CSS features that are included in my project are a hambuger menu that opens and closes by clicking the menu icon along with an animation that turns the lines that form the hamburger menu into an X to close it. The JavaScript feature that is included is a "Contact Us" form that displays a "Form Was Successfully Submitted" alert once the form is completed along with error messages if any of the fields are missing or entered incorrectly.
